The old INCLASS and MRL Event Handlers (TCL) and Definition Files (DEF) were removed from the NX1899 kit to avoid problems after NX updates.
These files are available in the Manufacturing Resource Library (MRL) kit found in the "wntx64\advanced_installations" directory of the Teamcenter installation kit.
The directory contains an "advanced_installations.zip" file with the MRL kit.

1.	Extract the advanced_installations.zip.
2.	Start the MRL Installer (setup.exe).
3.	Select the "Configure NX-CAM" option.
This copies the latest MRL files into the NX MACH directory.

Alternatively, copy the files manually from the directory "resource_management\MRL\nxlib\MACH" in the MRL kit to the NX MACH directory.
